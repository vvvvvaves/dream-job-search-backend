PostgreSQL security should be implemented as a **layered approach** combining both database-level and application-level controls. Here's how to think about it strategically:

## Database-Level Security (PostgreSQL Features)

**Core database security should absolutely be handled at the database level:**

- **Authentication and authorization** using PostgreSQL roles and privileges
- **Row-level security (RLS)** policies for fine-grained access control
- **SSL/TLS encryption** for connections
- **Database auditing** and logging
- **Network access controls** (pg_hba.conf)
- **Column-level encryption** for sensitive data at rest

This provides your foundational security layer that exists regardless of which application connects to the database.

## Application-Level Security (Python Backend)

**Your Python backend should handle:**

- **Input validation and sanitization** before queries reach the database
- **SQL injection prevention** through parameterized queries/ORM usage
- **Business logic authorization** (what users can do in your application context)
- **Session management** and authentication tokens
- **Rate limiting** and API security
- **Audit logging** of user actions
- **Data masking** for API responses

## Best Practices for PostgreSQL Security

**Database Configuration:**
- Use dedicated database users with minimal required privileges
- Enable SSL connections and disable plaintext when possible
- Configure pg_hba.conf to restrict connections by IP/network
- Enable logging for connections, disconnections, and DDL statements
- Regular security updates and patch management

**Access Control:**
- Implement principle of least privilege for all database roles
- Use row-level security policies for multi-tenant applications
- Grant permissions on specific tables/columns, not broad schema access
- Create application-specific roles rather than using superuser accounts

**Development Practices:**
- Always use parameterized queries or ORM methods that prevent SQL injection
- Never store credentials in code; use environment variables or secret management
- Implement connection pooling with proper authentication
- Regular security testing including SQL injection vulnerability scans

The key insight is that database security handles the "what data can be accessed" while application security handles the "who can perform what business operations." Both layers are essential for a robust security posture.
